Version: 0.3
Author: Nick Dunn <http://github.com/nickdunn/>
Build Date: 2009-06-01
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.2 (with jQuery 1.3)

## Installation

1. Download and upload the 'uploadify' folder to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable it by selecting "Uploadify" in the list and choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

## Usage

This extension adds the marvellous Uploadify jQuery plugin <http://uploadify.com/> to any "file" input field in Symphony. Although initially tested only on native File Uploads, this extension should also work for Hashed Upload, Unique Upload and any other upload fields released in the future.
